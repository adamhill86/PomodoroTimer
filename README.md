# PomodoroTimer
A Windows Forms C# implementation of a Pomodoro Timer. Refer to [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) for an explanation of the Pomodoro technique.

## Use
This app is very simple to use. Simply click the Start button and the countdown timer will begin. A Pomodoro lasts 25 minutes, after which a 5-minute break timer will start. You will also hear a beep sound when the timer ends so you can run this in the background. The timer will continue to run until you either hit Pause or exit the app.
